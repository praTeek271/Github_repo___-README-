Replace placeholders like `your-username` with your GitHub username and update sections like "Features," "Setup," and "Usage" with information specific to your project.

Once you've customized the README file, you can create a new repository on GitHub, push your code to it, and include the README file in the repository. Your GitHub project will have a clear and informative README that explains the purpose, usage, and other relevant details of your Django GitHub README Extractor project.
